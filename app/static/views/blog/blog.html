			<p class="blogHead">About Me</p>
			
	       	<p>Hi world!  My name is Forrest.  I'm a 25 year old guy from the US,
	       	leaving behind a high-paying job at a hedge fund for long-term,
        	low-budget travel around the world.  Here's the story of how I got here.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p> 
			I grew up in Kansas. Maybe it's because there wasn't much to do there and I had to 
			make my own entertainment, maybe it's just who I am, but I developed a taste for exploration and adventure. 
			My friends and I would ride our bikes around when we were younger, checking out new neighborhoods, occasionally 
			getting into trouble for our shenanigans. My adventure-seeking grew with time. I picked up pole vaulting in high school, which was a great 
			outlet for my energy. In college, I joined an awesome group of guys in a fraternity. 
			We drank a lot, did secret fraternity stuff, the whole deal. I studied neuroscience in school, and spent 
			as much time experimenting with substances outside of class as I did in my labs. 
			An amazing, fun, transformative, and surreal four years later, I graduated and was ready to move on.
			
			
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>
			And so I entered the "real world," a bright-eyed kid armed with a strong 
			sense of optimism and a newly acquired degree. Instead 
			of following the traditional neuroscience path of becoming a doctor or doing research, 
			I decided this was my chance to try out a job, make some money, and see what else was out there. 
			I was really lucky and managed to get a job at Goldman Sachs, so I was off to NYC! 
			Say what you want about the vampire squids, but I have a ton of respect for Goldman. 
			I was surrounded by talented, driven people, and they taught me how to really work. 
			At the same time, I got to live in an amazing city! I had a great group of friends, enough money for the expensive 
			lifestyle, and the youthful endurance needed to go out in the city that never 
			sleeps.
			
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>
			A fun and intense year later, I again got lucky and was offered a job at a 
			quantitative hedge fund in Connecticut. I accepted, jumping at the chance to 
			learn from former Harvard professors and some of the most respected people in 
			the quant world. But as I settled in, I realized I wasn't happy. Yes, I was 
			making more money than a 23 year old probably should and was living what looked 
			like a nice life. Black cars drove me from Connecticut back to NYC where I still 
			lived. I could (and am embarrassed to say, did) spend hundreds of dollars a 
			night on dinner or going out. But I wasn't happy. Life 
			wasn't about making money so I could buy nice things, then needing to make even more 
			money to buy even nicer things. I wanted to live an inspired life filled with 
			amazing people and experiences and help others do the same. I wanted to surround myself 
			with passionate, inspired people who were living the dream!
			
			
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>
			So here I am. Leaving behind the safety of a good, stable job for the adventure 
			of the road. Working to create something I believe in, to help others see the world that 
			I'm lucky enough to experience.
			
			</p>

            <p class="blogHead">Living Homelessly</p>
 			
 			<p>
 			At the end of January (2015) I got rid of my apartment, packed everything I needed into my backpack, 
 			and started living homelessly. It's been a great month, and especially great as my last 
 			month in the country! I've been able to see good friends one last time, save some 
 			extra money for my travels, and also test out my travel gear. I definitely 
 			recommend it for those who are planning a nomadic lifestlye.
 			
 			</p>
 			<br>
 			<p>
 			Still, it's not for everyone. I remember my first day of being homeless - I got back to the city 
 			around 6pm, the sun was going down, and I felt nervous that I might not find a place 
 			to sleep for the night. Luckily, my cousin James was around. We grabbed a drink, hung out 
 			at the bar for awhile, and I ended up crashing on his couch. It turned out to be a really fun night. 
 			Since then, I haven't felt that same twinge of nervousness. Instead, I've 
 			felt empowered, free to explore and move about. I've stayed with friends in New York, Connecticut, and even Colorado. 
 			With no worries of where I need to end up for the night, I've been able to be much more spontaneous.
 			
 			</p>
 			<br>
 			<p>
 			I've had great nights that started with no plans. One night I ended up going out with this cool girl 
 			from Tinder, meeting up with my friend from school, 
 			and getting brunch the next morning before work (weekday brunch is awesome by the way)! I've also had nights that went less smoothly. 
 			Another night I was at my friend's party, having a great time. We decided to go out to the lower 
 			east side and bust out our sweet dance moves. We got separated during the night, and I ended up not 
 			being able to stay at her place like I'd thought I would. I had this realization at around 3am. 
 			It also happened to be one of the coldest nights of the year! Luckily, another friend lived around 
 			the area, and I was able to sleep at his place. All in all, it's been a great experience. Even 
 			the unexpected, tough times have ended up as good memories.
 			
 			
 			<p/>
 			<br>
 			
 			<p>
 			Don't get me wrong, it's definitely nice to have a home. It's comfortable and stable, 
 			a great place to come back to and relax. You don't worry about where you're going to 
 			sleep, or shower, or go to the bathroom (turns out a gym membership is super useful, at least for the latter two). 
 			You don't worry about how you're going to 
 			fit a months worth of work clothes into a backpack. 
 			But at the same time, an apartment can become 
 			burdensome. It's been very freeing to finally remove the clutter from my life. 
 			My apartment was full of stuff I didn't need, but that I held onto, for some distant 
 			day in the future. I think it was mostly a fear of letting go. It's been nice to let go 
 			of that stuff, and then of my apartment too. 
 			Tomorrow, I'll be fully uncluttering my life by letting go of one last thing - my job.

			<p class="blogHead">Goodbye Corporate Life</p>
			
			<p>
			My last corporate email:
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			All,
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>
			Today is my last day at AQR.  Even though this wasn’t the place for me, I’m thankful 
			for my time here and for everything I’ve learned.  I now have a better understanding of 
			finance, of the “real world,” and more importantly, of myself.  I’ve learned to be more 
			practical, while realizing that I’m a deeply idealistic person.  I’ve learned to 
			appreciate the structure and routine of daily corporate life, while realizing that I 
			thrive in a dynamic, flexible environment.  Ultimately, I’ve learned that staying here 
			would mean not staying true to myself.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>
			That’s too bad, since staying here would put me on a very nice, comfortable path.  
			Year after year, we make more money.  We eat out at ever-fancier restaurants, then 
			come back to our progressively nicer houses.  We take our families on ever-more-luxurious 
			vacations.  But this isn’t the life I dream of.  Sure, it sounds like a good life.  
			I can’t argue with that.  It turns out that $400 meals can be pretty tasty.  And it’s 
			almost ridiculous to not be upset after waking up to a $600 bill from the night before 
			(thanks again for splitting that guys).  But still, I feel a lack of fulfillment.
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>
			What’s important to me is to have a purpose, to fight for something meaningful.  
			Yes, maybe our purpose is to help participants in underfunded pensions receive the 
			benefits they’ve been promised.  But if I really believed in that, I would work for 
			less money.  Instead, over the past few years I’ve become more and more obsessed with 
			making money, in part because I’ve used it as a measure of myself.  I worry that I’ve 
			lost the sense of purpose that I once felt, the desire to help the world in some 
			meaningful way.  Of course, I say all of this from a position of privilege, while 
			making enough to not be worried about money.  But now that I’m here, this is an 
			opportunity I can’t waste.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>
			So I’m making a change.  Wiping away this clear path toward “success” was tough.  
			The road ahead of me is less clear.  But too many people avoid taking the first step 
			forward, just because they can’t see where the path leads.  I don’t want to live my 
			life like that.  I’m off in pursuit of something more.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>
			I’ll be traveling the world, heading out on a one way flight to Thailand on March 11.  
			Not sure how long I’ll be abroad – I’m thinking a year or so to start.  At the same 
			time, I’ll be working on my own project.  You can follow my progress and travel 
			experiences here: <a href="#/blog">http://www.splashee.com/#/blog</a>.  Hope to 
			see some of you out on the road.
			</p>

			<p>What do I hope to accomplish over this next period of my life?  I hope to see the world
			and the amazing people and experiences it's filled with. To understand different perspectives
			and ways of life.  To be amazed and shocked, to question what I know and to grow from that.
			I want to put myself in new, untested environments.  To gauge my current
			views against what are now only unknown unknowns.
			I imagine there will be plenty of "what the fuck!?" moments - both good and
			bad.  
			
			Though there will be locals, backpackers, and other people around me, I imagine my true
			company will be myself.  It'll be a time to reflect, to enjoy my own company and

			<p class="blogHead">Thoughts</p>
			
			<p>
			13/3/2015 - Coming into this, I thought the experience of traveling, meeting new people and understanding
			new perspectives and cultures, seeing life through a different lens, would change me the most.
			After one day, I'm starting to think that the bigger benefit is having this unconstrained
			time, away from the daily pressures of survival and away from the influences I've surrounded
			myself with.  I can observe myself more objectively, or maybe less objectively?  Either way,
			it's different and seems beneficial.  I'll be noting thoughts I have and observations I
			make about myself in a "thoughts" section from now on.  One thing so far.  I watched a great
			documentary before I came called "A Map For Saturday."  It details one man's year abroad,
			with perspectives from multiple other backpackers along the way.  It's really great.  In 
			the film, one major comment at the start was how people felt this deep sense of loneliness,
			and that made them want to reach out and connect with whoever was around them.  I haven't
			felt this at all.  Maybe it's still too early, maybe I'm more introverted, maybe something else.
			</p>
			<br>
			
			
			<p>
			14/3/2015 - The future of learning.  Things started off as apprenticeships.  Blacksmiths trained
			other blacksmiths, artists trained artists, etc.  But in those times, most people learned
			what they were supposed to learn, based on their positions in society, etc.  Then came
			the industrial revolution.  Things grew big, we mechanized things, gained economies of 
			scale, and distributed to the masses.  Including education.  We created universities to 
			with different types of standard degrees, taught people in a mostly-standardized lecture
			format, and cranked out degrees.  The future will be smaller, more specific, better tailored.  
			Technology makes this more feasible.</p>
			<p>Work art into everything.  Create something beautiful.  Yes, it's good to be practical
			and design something to make money and support you.  It's better if you can incorporate some
			mission that aligns with your purpose.  But why not make it beautiful, a work of art.  I 
			saw some really amazing art today.  The artists spent so long on little details that
			made the art awe-inspiring.  Do that.  There should be more internet-based, quant-y,
			art.</p>
			<p>I want to try meditation for an extended period of time.  Applied for a 10-day meditation
			retreat in Malaysia today.  I think it'll be really good for reflecting.</p>
			
			<p>
			18/3/2015 - Structurally happy.  I think I've begun shifting away from that quick, immediate,
			reactive, giddy happiness to a calmer, longer-term, structural happiness.  I do still
			lose myself in moments of joy.  I also have put myself in </p>
			
			<p>Not a linear thinker.  E.g. have tons of these thoughts and pieces in progress, but
			they're still scattered, need to bring them together.<p>
			
			<p>This guy's got some sweet ideas - check them out: http://yanngirard.typepad.com/yanns_blog/2014/05/waiting-your-life-away.html
			</p>
			
			
			<p>
			My sensation of time is so distorted when traveling.  Maybe it's because there are so many
			new experiences, time seems like it's stretching out so much in the present.  I remember
			after spending a little less than a day on Tioman Island, it felt like we'd been here for almost a week.
			Crazy!
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Education, exposure, and traveling the world.  I want to research education and traveling.
			Melanie grew up in a village in Germany.  I think a farming village - research this later: Seeg.
			I would never have guessed - she seems well educated, well traveled, etc.  I guess maybe
			the only thing is that she doesn't really know how to use her credit card that well.
			But more to the point, she said people in her village are realy close-minded and racist.
			She was the most educated one in her class.  She got sent to some special higher education
			place further away than the regular school.  I think farmers also have a better "saving for a
			rainy day" mentality.  Something else to look into.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			For the site.  Someone needs to consolidate everything into one central location for
			travelers/backpackers.  There's already too much going on every time you get wifi.
			Have to answer emails, check flights, check texts, tell people you're still alive.
			Should have some central thing that automaticall updates your location.  Sends a signal
			to those following you that you're still alive.  Can customize the message.  Show your plans
			and routes.  Keep track of your expenses, etc.  Question is which things are most essential?

			<p class="blogHead">First Stop - Bangkok!</p>
			
			
			<p>After what felt like a surprisingly short flight from NYC to Bangkok (layover in Stockholm),
			I landed in Bangkok!  First things first - I walked around the airport looking for food to 
			refuel before trying to find my hostel.  It took me a couple tries to follow
			the signs to the food court; apparently you're supposed to walk through the bathrooms to 
			find the food court on the other side.  I got 35 baht worth of food tickets
			(~33 baht = 1 USD), and used those to buy a water and some stir fried veggies over rice.  At the
			sauce station, I decided to be bold and ladle some of this mystery brown sauce over part of my
			rice.  Not my best move.  It ended up being this kind of heavy, stinky, sweet-sour sauce.
			Oh well, live and learn.  The natural flavor of the stir friend veggies was pretty good, 
			so all in all still a solid meal.  At this point, I figured I now had ~1 hour timeframe 
			to get to my hostel before the diarrhea hit :O !  Gotta perform under pressure.  Luckily,
			Hostelworld had really straightforward directions, and it was a nice trip over to the 
			Saphaipae Hostel.  Also, no diarrhea!  Maybe the airport food was just really clean,
			maybe the boiling hot water for dipping the utensils in at the utensil station actually killed 
			some germs.
			</p>

			<p>
			I made my way up to my room, which was a 10 bed mixed room.  Nice, clean quarters,
			with air conditioning too, all for 10 USD/night.  There are two
			dudes and a girl in there when I arrive, and we start chatting. We talk about Bangkok, partying,
			the <a class="underline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_Nine">Bali Nine</a>, relationships
			on the road, a whole bunch of stuff.  
			
			I find the dynamic of dating while both people are traveling really interesting. 
			One of the guys has been traveling since 2011, and
			has recently been dating a Finnish girl.  They're going through a rough patch and she's out
			of the country, but apparently they have a pretty sweet apartment in downtown Bangkok so 
			who knows where that's going.

			<p>
			We get to talking about activities for the day.  It turns out the girl is leaving the hostel
			today, and she gives me a couple thousand Cambodian riel (in case I end up going there) before
			she heads out.  It converts to less than 1 USD, but maybe good for a meal or something.
			One of the guys also heads out, after deciding to climb
			up this 49-story abandoned <a class="underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUoGi_KGDbM">
			"ghost tower"</a>.  It looked pretty sweet, but I wanted to explore the area some more first, 
			so I decided to give myself a walking tour around the <a class="underline" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang_Rak_District">Bang Rak</a> 
			district where my hostel is.  I wandered away from the more commercial/touristy areas, into the alleys
			that were lined with little stands.  The atmospere reminded me a lot of China, maybe Shanghai, 
			but cleaner, more organized, and a bit quieter.  All the delicious smells from the street
			foods were calling to me, so I stopped for another small meal.  I went for some mystery 
			street meat, with some kind of leafy green vegetable, over rice.  The meat was nice, savory,
			and stew-y, with some bitterness from the veggies.  Pretty flavorful and overall, nice solid
			meal.  I was more worried about how my stomach would handle this meal from a random street
			stand, but still, the iron stomach held strong :) .
			</p>
			<br>
			
			
			<img ng-src="../img/picPool/BridgeViewO.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
			<p>
			After wandering what felt like a few miles in each direction, I got lost.  It was a
			nice chance to talk to some locals and try to figure out directions (backup pre-downloaded 
			map on my phone, and also a map from the hostel, but I'd rather ask someone).  I talked to a few
			people who looked around my age, and they all spoke decent English.  Though apparently not good enough,
			because the last kid I asked directions from told me the opposite way, and so I ended up accidentally 
			crossing the Chao Phraya River.  No biggie, there was a nice view from the bridge,
			I got some extra exercise, and saw more of the city.  I also got pretty good at dodging
			cars, since there were almost no stop lights in the area and I had to cross the streets somehow.</p>

			Other people's influence.  Every interaction influences you.  While coming to Thailand
			removes some of the influence of habits and people I've been surrounded by back in the US,
			it also introduces other influences.  It can be hard to go against norms, ie there's strong
			familial pressures in chinese society.  But it's also good, as it can show me what things
			I like and don't like.
			
			
			
			
			<p>This started off being a post about the events of today.  Who I've been hanging out with,
			what I've been spending time doing, what has excited me, frustrated me, surprised me, etc.  
			That stuff is kind of interesting.  But after
			spending today walking and eating my way around Bangkok, I came back home (to the hostel), 
			opened up "The Little Prince," and 
			did some reading.  That got me to do some thinking.  
			
			Over the course of my travels, I fully expect to be changed by my experiences.  These experiences
			will probably help me to grow as a person.  Before today, I'd thought that would be the biggest
			benefit of taking this time off to travel.  But now I think the more important part is just taking
			time off, away from the daily pressures and routine of work.  As I walked down the 
			street today, I saw people going about their everyday lives.  The everyday 
			lives of people in Bangkok are not so different from the everyday lives of people in New York.
			People think about whether they're doing a good job at work.  They worry if they're going 
			to be able to pick their kids up on time.  Maybe it's about time to take their car (or
			moped in Thailand) in for a checkup. They focus on immediate, tangible
			issues and goals.  It's similar to keeping your inbox clean.  It feels very productive
			to manage your inbox, responding to and categorizing new emails. But you can easily 
			lose sight of the big picture - are you really doing the most essential thing to reach
			your goals right now?			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			What do I hope to accomplish over this next period of my life?  I hope to see the world
			and the amazing people and experiences it's filled with. To understand different perspectives
			and ways of life.  To be amazed and shocked, to question what I know and to grow from that.
			I want to put myself in new, untested environments.  To gauge my current
			views against what are now only unknown unknowns.
			I imagine there will be plenty of "what the fuck!?" moments - both good and
			bad.  
			
			Though there will be locals, backpackers, and other people around me, I imagine my true
			company will be myself.  It'll be a time to reflect, to enjoy my own company and
			better understand who I am and what I want.  I have a certain set of ideas now, 
			and we'll see how these hold up.
			
			No matter what, I'll treasure this time and opportunity that I have.  But I do fear some
			consequences.  Not of disease, injury, and crime, though those are real issues.  I fear
			that this trip will take me off the deep end. That by becoming some blend of all these different
			worlds, I'll never be able to integrate into any individual one. That I'll be so changed by the experience that
			I wont ever accept a more "normal" life.  I know already that's

			<p class="blogHead">Bangkok - Food</p>
			<p>
			Had some good food and nice conversation at lunch.  I was on my way to check out the 
			Bangkok Arts and Culture Center, got hungry, so started scouting out restaurants.  Finally,
			I decided to go into this small-ish place that was pretty filled with local people.  I sat
			down and pointed to a picture of what looked like flat noodles and meat.  The owner
			warned me that it was spicy, and so we started talking.  Turns out
			he's wasn't Thai, he was actually Chinese (third generation in Thailand).  As I found out later, Chinese people
			seem to integrate pretty well into Thailand.  I guess he'd integrated a bit too well and
			didn't speak Mandarin, and since my Thai-speaking abilities were non-existent so far, we 
			stumbled along in English.  He was really curious about my background, and really 
			eager to share his.  Also, really proud of the food that he made.
			I capped off that meal with some interesting dessert, which
			he explained was some red, gel-like water-chestnut, relatively rare, thick-skinned coconut
			(1 of these for 4 regular coconuts), in coconut milk/syrup.

			<p>
			I wasn't quite sure what to do with my now-seemingly-unlimited spare time.  Since I happened to
			be in Bangkok, I Googled a few things to do, and decided on the Bangkok Arts and Culture Center (BACC). 
			So I set out with a rough idea of where to go, and hungrily keeping an eye out for good food on the way.  
			Maybe it was getting a bit late for lunch, but most of the places I passed were empty.  Finally,

			<p>Stomach full, I continued my journey to the BACC.  As I got closer, I decided to go into a store to make sure I was
			heading the right way.  After stepping out, I found myself at this mall-ish place called I'm
			Park (yes, really spelled like that), listening to live music played by overall-wearing 
			high-schoolers.  Stores 
			at the mall included Domino's, a math workout center, and a Botox clinic.  I continued on,
			by the National Stadium (host of the FIFA 2015 World Deaf Futsal Championships) and finally to the 
			BACC.  Really cool art in there, but unfortunately they didn't allow photography throughout a lot of it.

			<p class="blogHead">Asiatique with Gift</p>
			<p>
			I met up this evening with Gift, a friend from Wash U.  She's been back in Thailand for
			about a year now.  We decided to take a boat over to Asiatique, this kind of outdoor mall/market/carnival
			thing.  Like Chinese culture, food seems to be a huge part of Thai culture.  We walked around
			to all the little stands and Gift pointed out some foods I should try.  We ended up with
			a bunch of little dishes - some spicy papaya salad, thai sausage (fermented and regular),
			squid stuffed with egg, salmon.  It was fun to try out a little of everything.  We walked
			around for a bit more then decided to sit down and grab a couple of Chang beers.  We caught
			up on everything that's happened since we've graduated, reminisced about what an awesome time 
			college was, talked about Thailand.  It was interesting to hear that her transition back to Thailand wasn't
			that easy; I guess she'd been gone a long time.  I really liked hearing about the cultural differences
			between Thailand and the US.  For instance, the perception of time/timeliness.  Like when a bus is leaving at 
			8am, it actually leaves when it fills up with people.  Thai people seem much more relaxed about
			when things occur, and people don't really seem to be in too much of a rush.  Generally pretty
			chill.  There also seems to be a religious/superstitious tint over a lot of things.  
			I definitely want to learn more about Buddhism, it seems like it's got some sweet
			ideas.

			<p class="blogHead">Visit From Andrew</p>
			<p>
			My friend Andrew (a trader on Wall Street) just got a new job, and so was out traveling
			for a few weeks.  He'd been around Thailand and Australia (which he loved), and was stopping
			by Bangkok for a few hours before his flight back to NYC.  We met up at the Phaya Thai metro
			station and walked around in search of food.  We eventually settled on a western place,
			grabbed some drinks and a sandwich, and chatted for awhile.  </p>
			<br>
			<p>Andrew's tour sounded pretty cool.  Parts were adventurous (maybe a bit
			too adventurous for some - an older couple had ended up in the hospital after some boating mishaps), 
			parts were domestic (learning to cook Thai food), and overall seemed like a nice, balanced
			tour that gave them a flavor of local life.  I'll learn some things from that organization.  
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Most of the people on his tour were older, and some
			were retired and traveling around the world.  I couldn't easily find age distributions
			for around-the-world travelers, but based on my experience I'd guess that most tend to be the young
			(<25) or the old (>65, or retired).  For some reason there's some period during the bulk of people's lives
			when they just don't travel.  Maybe it's due to the stability requirements of having children, 
			maybe it's a societal thing.  It reminds me of this Japanese dude in my hostel, who was on a final
			month-long trip around Asia before starting his job.  As he said, this was his last chance to travel,
			and then his life was over.  The sad thing about it is that he didn't say it in that half-joking
			way that some Americans might have.  He said it like he truly believed that after this trip,
			he had a lifetime of work ahead of him with no end in sight but death (which as he told me
			was how it was).  Bummer.</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Ok sorry, back to lunch.  As Andrew
			observed, NYC has the best of a lot of things.  He expected Thai food here to be very different
			or in some way better than Thai food in New York, but was disappointed.  Similar taste, lower
			sanitation standard, slow service, etc.  While I tend not to think of things in terms
			of better or worse, I think many people from the US would agree with him.  And this reminds
			me that I think I have a different utility function
			than many people.  I appreciate that the service is slow - it reminds me that there's a
			very different concept of time than the one I'm used to experiencing.  I don't like the
			lower sanitation standard, but like the reminder that people are used to living in very 
			different conditions than the sheltered world I come from.</p>

			<p class="blogHead">Outdoor Gym</p>
			
			<p>
			I was getting some workout-withdrawal after about a week of not doing much.  My roommates
			told me there was an outdoor gym at this place called Lumpini (or Lumphini) Park,
			so I geared up and headed over.  It was about half an hour walk down Silom Road, a really
			lively road lined with lots of little food and merchant stands.  As I got
			closer to the park, the streets got more crowded and live music started popping up.  After a 20-minute
			detour to listen to some good music, I continued my trek to the park.  Let's stop there for 
			me to reflect on and appreciate that detour.  Back when I was caught up in the day-to-day
			hustle of NYC, I would NEVER give myself the time to stop en-route to my destination to
			listen to music for 20 minutes.  Having the time and freedom to stop and appreciate the
			beauty of life around me is incredibly awesome.  I think it's definitely a skill that can
			be improved, and I aim to improve.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			The sun was setting
			by the time I got to Lumpini Park, but the park was still pretty full with joggers and walkers.  
			I think working out is a lot less common in asia than in the US, and this was one of the 
			few places I've seen where people have actually been jogging outside.  It's not like NYC
			where you see runners everywhere on the streets.  After a bit of wandering around,
			I was able to find the little outdoor gym. Got in a nice circuit-training workout, 
			grabbed a bite to eat on the way back, and headed back home to the hostel.

			<p class="blogHead">Meditation Retreat</p>
			
			<p>
				As I mentioned before, I was talking to a friend from school (Gift) in Bangkok
				and got interested in meditation.  I applied for a spot in a 10-day meditation
				retreat (website <a class="underline" href="http://dhamma.org.au/v/a/app?re=asia&sc=my&co=522&la=EN">
				here</a>) and was accepted, so I hopped
				on a flight to Johor Bahru, Malaysia.  Here are my thoughts.
				
				</p>
				<p>
				<br>
				Wow.  10 days, 10 hours of meditation a day.  No contact with the outside world.  
				No speaking, eye contact, or gestures with other students.  No reading or writing material allowed.  
				It was a long time to spend with my own thoughts, but ultimately a great experience and I'm thankful 
				to get this experience at the start of my trip! 
			</p>

				<p>Ok - get ready for a wall of text.  A few pictures to help you get through it all
				(taken at the end of the retreat - no phone allowed during).  I've also sprinkled in
				a couple of pictures my fellow meditators sent me throughout the text, so look forward to those!</p>

				Overall, I think Vipassana meditation has a really nice philosophy.  A lot of things I agree with, 
				a couple things I dont.  Oh yeah, keep in mind everything that follows is my interpretation of what 
				I experienced during the course.  I'll do more outside research over time, and welcome 
				comments/critiques on things I may have misunderstood.
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<p>
				The core idea was that unhappiness is not external, but is instead created by the 
				individual.  They told us a story I thought illustrated this nicely.  There was a great
				painter, who painted a beautiful, captivating, amazing portrait of a woman.  He looked
				at the painting and could not live without it - he was in love with this painting,
				wanted bring it home, lock himself away and just be with the painting forever.  People
				said, "Are you mad?  This is a painting, you drew it yourself!"  A second painter paints
				the same woman, but paints a horrifying, ugly picture of the woman.  He's 
				disgusted and terrified by his painting and wants to run away from it and hide.  Again, people
				question whether the man is mad - after all, he painted this image himself!  Finally, there
				are two ordinary men, gazing at a woman before them.  The first man
				can't live without her, wants to run away with her and be with her forever.  The second man
				is disgusted and terrified by the woman.  Are these two men not mad in the same way
				the painters are mad?  They've painted different pictures of the same woman, and each reacts to his own image.
				Vipassana meditation tries to make us aware that we are all painters,
				and have some control over the world we create.</p>
				
				<br>
				<p>Ok, enough theory.  I love that Vipassana is grounded in practice, individual experience, 
				self-observation.  So let's get into what actually happened.  I land in Johor Bahru and make
				my way over to the meetup point, funnily enough in front of a KFC at the side of the road.
				Me and a British dude (Dannie) get picked up by a local girl (Natasha), her mom and her aunt.  
				It's Natasha's first time doing this as well, and her aunt tells us a bit about "aches and pains"
				halfway through the course, and then the good stuff that happens once you're past that.
				It was all very vague-sounding, and so we headed into the course with barely any idea
				what to expect.  I sign in and settled into our quarters, ready to see what happens over the
				next week and a half.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				The next morning I'm woken up at 4am by a gong.  Off to the meditation hall!
				The first day we spent entirely focused on breathing.  I hadn't really meditated before 
				(besides a training session at Goldman) and found it tough 
				to focus my mind for hours at a time.  My mind would wander off in seemingly random 
				directions, and eventually find its way back to my breath.  At first I had to breathe heavily,
				controlling my breath, just to notice it. It was actually pretty 
				tough to only observe my breath without changing it.  It felt a bit like trying to lucid 
				dream, when as soon as I become aware I'm dreaming that shocks me into waking up.  
				Over the hours, I was slowly able to fall into natural breathing and as the instructors 
				said, to "just observe", my breath.  I was surprised at how light ny natural breathing was.  
				By the end of the day I was constantly observing my breath, even when not meditating. 
				Or maybe just constantly meditating.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				The second day echoed the first.   Another 10 hours focused on my breath.  
				Since I hadn't read up on Vipassana before the course, and since the course hadn't yet explained the process, 
				I was pretty confused over what we were supposed to be experiencing.  I subtly felt that my mind
				was calmer and more stable, with fewer bouts of wandering off in random directions.  I wondered if meditation 
				might actually decrease creativity because of this.  Intinctively, I think not.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Despite 
				feeling like time passed relatively quickly while meditating, I began to look forward to 
				events that broke the monotony.  Our 6am and 11am meals were really nice.  Usually some rice, 
				a few vegetarian dishes, and soup.  Plus some dessert or fruit.  I usually don't like 
				what I call fake meat, but theirs was actually really good with very meaty texture.  
				My favorite time of day was early evening tea.  They would brew this "cooling herbal tea."  
				Really soothing, purplish tea, a bit sweet and earthy tasting.  I would grab a piece of fruit, 
				often guava with maple sugar, and walk around the courtyard.  My favorite tree was 
				this one with spiky leaves.  There was also a 
				little pond that I noticed people kept going to.  I was curious, wandered over, and 
				saw this cool little terrapin in it.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Day 3 - We finally moved on from focusing on breathing!  We moved attention to feeling 
				sensations around the nose and area above the upper lip, and then to only sensations 
				on the upper lip.  Good thing I've been growing this mustache!  The easiest things to 
				feel were wind from breathing, coldness and heat, and little tingles. The reason 
				for focusing on this area is apparently the smaller the area of focus, the sharper the mind becomes. 
				For the next day and a half we focused on this small area.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				One thing I haven't mentioned 
				yet is evening discourses.  For about an hour a day, we'd watch a video lesson from 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._N._Goenka">S.N. Goenka</a>.  This would provide 
				more of the theory behind Vapassana, and behind what we were doing for the day.  
				By Day 3, I was starting to get an idea of why we were spending so long focusing on 
				breathing and this small area above our upper lip.  People usually have the perspective of 
				looking out at the world, and here we were developing a new perspective of looking inwards. 
				Instead of sensing the external world and reacting unconsciously, we 
				would try to alter our unconscious reactions with better mind-body awareness.  
				I'm not totally sure about 
				the causality but the idea was that perceptions of the outside world create reactions linked to sensations 
				on the body.  For instance, you can see how if you are angry at something, your 
				breathing may become heavier, and your body may feel warmer.  The clever idea here 
				is that you can train your subconscious mind to become aware of these sensations when 
				you react to something.  Then you can draw your conscious awareness to recognize and accept 
				the sensation, and watch it pass, instead of multiplying your reactions through 
				attachment or aversion to the sensation.  This can
				help break habit patterns that cause unhappiness.  
				Whether it's pain or pleasure, heaviness or lightness, heat or cold, tingling, perspiration, 
				numbness, any sensation will arise and pass away.  The nature of everything is temporary - 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence" class="underline">anicca</a>.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				The end goal is to develop perfect equanimity.  You are agnostic to feelings of fear or anger, 
				misery, but surprisingly to me, also feelings of attachment and passion. Apparently 
				since pleasant feelings will eventually go away, you want to get rid of attachment 
				to them.  
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<p>
				Day 4 - Today was the big day!  This was the day when we were going to move 
				to the heart of Vipassana.  Halfway through the day, we moved our attention away from 
				sensations on our upper lip, piece by piece around the rest of our body.  
				This was a huge shock!  We started at the tops of our heads, and by the time I got 
				to my neck and shoulders I was feeling a lot of pain.  Luckily Natasha's mom had 
				given us some warning of aches and pains.  I guess it was no surprise after sitting 
				in meditation for three and a half days, but the sudden sensitivity to the stiffness, 
				the deep soreness, and heaviness in my body was overwhelming.  We weren't supposed to 
				move so I couldn't even try to stretch out, and the idea is that sensations arise and 
				pass away, so I bore the pain.  It was a rough hour.  We took a five minute break 
				and then continued.  I was NOT looking forward to the next couple of hours.  There's 
				that aversion to sensation that I was supposed to be getting rid of :P.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				After our break, I went 
				back and continued moving my attention bit by bit down my body. This time, when 
				I got to my shoulders, something new and really great happened.  The sensations of 
				the different areas of my body started blending together, and things started vibrating.  
				As I pushed focus around to other areas, they got merged into this feeling, and soon 
				my whole body was buzzing/humming and it felt like every cell was feeling every 
				sensation at once!  It reminded me a bit of the come-up to some of my 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2PXRtYxuOs&t=1m2s">ecstatic</a> moments.  
				I would later learn that I was experiencing uniform subtle sensations, as opposed to 
				the gross sensations I was feeling earlier.  Since I had the impression I had jumped 
				ahead, I spent the next day and a half experimenting with this feeling, pushing it 
				stronger, figuring out how to activate it quickly, shifting the focal point to different 
				areas of the body, etc.  This was really great, but apparently I overdid it and grew 
				attached to the uniform suble sensations.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				My mind focused on the feeling and would not let it go.  The 
				sensation became so strong and persistent that at night I would stay awake for hours 
				because my body was buzzing so hard.  By the second night of this, I had gotten to a 
				kind of breaking point.  From talking to others after the course, it seemed like this 
				was something a lot of people felt around this time.  For some, past health issues came up.  
				One guy had noticed or thought that his breathing had actually stopped.  Since he 
				was born with lung issues and had pneumonia or something bad before, he actually got 
				rushed to the hospital late one night, where apparently the doctors said he was fine.  
				I guess when you're doing the deep "mental surgery" that we were doing, as Goenka put it, 
				deep issues come up.  Others just couldn't take it and thought about leaving.  One 
				of the girls became convinced that this black man was showing up in front of her 
				while she was sleeping.  
				</p>
				Bonus pic of us pushing Blank's car out of a ditch.  It had gotten stuck that night
				when he was rushed to the hospital:
				</p>
				<br>
				<img ng-src="../img/picPool/BlanksCarO.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
				
				<br>
				<p>For me, I was worried that I was falling into insanity as 
				I tried to be rational.  I created this feeling on my own, I thought, and now it's 
				so strong that it keeps me awake.  Why can't I will this away?  It seemed to me that 
				I had gone so far into my mind that I couldn't pull myself 
				out.  Or maybe I had spent so much time focusing on this during the day that my 
				subconscious continued to focus on it, and I had to retrain my subconscious.  
				Reminds me a bit of this Paul Graham <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html" class="underline">
				article</a>.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				But after days of attempting to retrain my focus on my 
				breath, with limited success, I slowly just let it go.  And that's what I needed 
				to do from the start, according to the Vipassana technique.  I accepted that this 
				is how I was going to feel, and this mental detachment helped stop the 
				magnification/multiplication of my aversion to the feeling.  Over the rest of the course, 
				I was able to sleep better.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Though I struggled at night, I enjoyed this same 
				experience during the day.  It helped me deal well with the removal of Sankara.  
				The idea is that as we sit, we notice sensations come to the body.  We remain 
				<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equanimity" class="underline">equanimous</a> 
				whether they are pleasant or unpleasant sensations, and as the sensations pass we have 
				purified ourselves more.  I wasn't the most still meditator, but I could spend 
				an hour at a time during our periods of strong determination sitting completely still.  
				When I chose to.  In some cases I just didn't see the benefit of remaining equanimous.  
				Sure, sensations arise and pass.  But it's not always best to just observe.  
				Sensations can be signals from your body that you need to take action.  During one of 
				my personal sessions with the instructor I asked her (we can break noble 
				silence to ask the instructor questions) about a hypothetical situation 
				where you hit your arm on a table.  With an equanimous mindset, you can say ok, 
				I feel this pain, it will arise and pass away.  But then maybe you don't go to the 
				doctor, who would tell you your arm is broken and you need to put it in a cast to 
				let it heal properly.  Her answer was that in one case you would know because the 
				pain continues, but I wasn't very satisfied with that answer.
				</p>
				<br>


				<p>
				Besides focusing on removing Sankara, I also experimented with different sensations 
				that arose as I thought about different things, to get a better idea of what strong 
				attachments I had. 
				Unsurprisingly, attachment to my family was super strong.  After days of trying to 
				practice equanimity, my body had a natural tendency to sweep away sensations.  But here, 
				I was very resistant to this sweep away, and eventually my body stopped trying.  Another 
				strong sensation I felt was the feeling associated with appreciation of the beauty of 
				the world, the magic of living, the overwhelming awe of amazing people and experiences 
				that happen.  Interestingly, this was a similar sensation to the one I felt when 
				thinking about my family.  I guess I'm really attached to that sensation.  I think 
				the desire to share that sensation with others will be part if the mission behind this site.
				</p>
<br>
				<p>
				By Day 8 or 9 I felt I had reached some stable point of equanimity.  Not the perfect 
				equanimity of Vapassana but a level I was happy with.  It was cool to see a change in 
				others and myself in our daily interactions.  Things that we would have gotten upset 
				about at the start, we were now understanding of.  I think much had to do with reducing the 
				ego, another form of attachment.  I remember getting annoyed at some point when this old dude 
				just jumped in front of me while I was waiting to use the sink to wash my dishes.  
				I realize that much of my angry or annoyed reactions are based in my ego.  Putting 
				more importance on myself or what I want than on what others want, which I think is somewhat 
				natural but which I think I could work to reduce.  On the other hand 
				there is a need to stand up for oneself when the time arises. Like everything, 
				some balance.  Actually one of the main things I think Vapassana does is to try 
				to dissolve the ego. Seems kind of contradictory since it's also focusing on the
				self.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Day 10 was great.  We broke noble silence in the morning, and we finally started 
				connecting with others.  We also got three full meals, instead of two meals and tea.  
				It's difficult to appreciate what you have until it's taken away.  When you're healthy, 
				you don't appreciate what you have until you're sick.  When you can talk you don't 
				appreciate that until it's taken away. 
				</p><br>
				<p>
				Bonus pic #2 - me and the meditation bros:
				</p>

				<br>
				<p>
				Some closing/random thoughts from 10 days in my own head.
				I wish I'd gotten to write them all down.  
				Vapassana is very much about living in the present moment.  One framework that 
				came out of meditating was categorizing thoughts based on past and future, positive and negative.  
				I found most of my thoughts were focused on the future, and positive.  Especially thoughts surrounding 
				career and that aspect of life.  With thoughts about people and relationships, most of my thoughts 
				were about the past and positive. I do think I'm lucky in that I'm biased towards positive thoughts 
				and happiness.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				I realize that I do have some obsessive tendencies, and I struggle because I have a 
				strong desire to control myself.  I have strong attachments that I don't want to give up.  Equanimity is good for dealing 
				with anger/annoyment, but I want to experience big highs associated with passion and attachment, 
				and I'm ok with the accompanying big lows.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Actually, I think I get attached to others easily, and want to control this. These attachments
				conflict with my desire for freedom and independence.  I think I often defer to what 
				others want and have a desire to please them.  I have strong views of my own too.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				I had a thought I wanted to research some more - what people wish for at the end of their
				lives.  That seems like an important perspective to consider.  In the end, what will
				matter?

			<p class="blogHead">Crossroads</p>
			<p>

			After the meditation retreat, we got dropped of at the side of the road
			next to the main highway.  People had plans to head to Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Singapore,
			all over. Some were getting picked up, some were taking the bus, some were hitchhiking.
			I hadn't made any plans for after the retreat, but I had been considering heading down to 
			Singapore, either on a bus with this guy from Barcelona (Mane) or maybe grabbing a ride with someone
			driving down there.  It was a new city and I had a family friend I could stay with, so maybe a cool place to 
			check out.  After talking to some of the Singaporeans, I was less psyched to head there.
			It seemed like a hectic, stressed out place, with a lot of the asian focus on prestige and
			being the best along a well-defined track.  Ok that's probably not a fair representation,
			but I wasn't feeling it.  I ended up talking to a German girl (Miriam) who was headed
			to this island called Tioman Island.  It was a few hours north, and apparently a really
			beautiful island.  I flipped through her Lonely Planet guide, and it sounded
			awesome - great beaches, jungles, a nice relaxing place to ease back into the real world
			after 10 days of meditation.  So me and this other German girl (Melanie), who was also thinking about
			heading to Singapore but changed her mind, hopped in a car with Miriam and a fellow meditator
			and got dropped off at the nearest bus station.  At the bus station, I really saw and appreciated
			the trust travelers/backpackers have with each other.  Miriam and Melanie left me - a relative stranger
			- to watch their stuff while they used the restroom.  And I left them to guard our
			stuff while I scouted for tickets.  Very cool.  We got lucky and managed to rush onto a bus 
			that was just pulling out of the station, and were on the way to Tioman Island!

			<p class="blogHead">First Night in Tioman</p>
			<p>
				After a few hours on the bus and some confusion over the ferry ticketing counters, we
				were finally on the ferry to Tioman.  Melanie was pretty tired and napped for a bit, while
				me and Miriam chatted.  Miriam was on a career break from an intense job that had 
				taken her around Germany, France, and Switzerland.  Over the next couple of hours, I
				got perspective on everything from food differences between the countries to
				what's it's like being a woman in each place.  From worries of future motherhood to gender 
				power dynamics in the workplace.  Props to Miriam for learning how to deal with such
				a male-dominated work environment.  At the same time, bummer for having to 
				face that in the first place.  I've started to see more awareness of some of the issues
				women face in the workplace, and I hope that as word spreads, things will get better.  
				Our conversation continued from there, on to personality, self-discovery, girl looks vs guy status,
				etc.  So our ferry ride passed quickly and before we realized,
				we were on Tioman!
				</p>
				<img ng-src="../img/picPool/TiomanBeach2O.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
				
				<br>
				<p>We landed on Tioman Island
				in the early evening. Miriam had planned a kind of around-the-world meditation/spiritual trip for herself, and
				so had already booked her hostel.  Like me, Melanie is more of an in-the-moment traveler 
				(I would guess a strong "P" in Myers-Briggs tests), and so we ended up on this beautiful
				island with no place to stay.  We started off by walking from the pier 
<!-- 				(Schtiek? in German) -->
				to Miriam's place to drop off our backpacks.  Melanie had jumped off a really high waterfall
				a couple months ago and landed wrong, and still had some back pain, so we helped carry some
				of her stuff.  
				Apparently the first few days after she had mis-landed, she couldn't even move and just had
				to lay there - pretty scary!  It's been getting better slowly.  
				</p>
				
				<br>
			<p>
				Miriam's hostel was
				fully booked, and the area we were staying in didn't have many other hostels, especially
				not cheaper hostels, so me and Melanie packed some overnight stuff from our main bags 
				and started scouting out places to sleep.  <!-- 
We walked
				along the beach for awhile, and found a rock-enclosed shelter that looked like it could 
				be nice.  We thought the tides might come up or there might be sandflies/mosquitos, so
				it wasn't the best choice.  Miriam's hostel had a treehouse on the beach we thought would
				be a fun place to stay.  Since Miriam was staying there, we did things the
				legit way and ask the girl at the hostel if we could sleep up there.  Unfortunately,
				the hostel manager said we couldn't and so our search continued.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
 -->
				Our walk to get dinner took us by
				a police station.  Across from that was this barbed-wire enclosed recreation area
				where kids were playing this volleyball-like game with their feet.  We explored a couple
				of buildings next to the court and found one with some nice space
				and also something that looked like a giant pool table inside.  It seemed promising,
				so now that we had a spot it was time for dinner!
				We stopped 
				by a night market and got some spicy pho-like noodles with veggies and fishballs,
				and some coconut, corn, and sugar-filled crispy pancakes for dessert.
				</p>
				<img ng-src="../img/picPool/HackeyBallO.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
				<img ng-src="../img/picPool/PoolTableO.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
				
				<br>
			<p>
				After dinner we parted ways with Miriam.  We walked back to the pier, which we decided 
				could also make a nice sleeping spot.  It was still pretty early, maybe 9pm, so we just
				sat and talked for awhile.  I like chatting with travelers, because it feels like conversations
				are more real.  Past a lot of the superficial formalities you would be talking about
				with other people you'd known for the same amount of time.  I'm curious why that's the
				case.  Maybe personality types are more similar, maybe the shared experience of traveling
				creates an automatic bond, maybe something else.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Melanie was from a small village in Germany (Seeg?), and was the only person who 
				had ever really traveled abroad.  So she was seen as the crazy one.  From my readings
				on backpacker studies, a lot of backpackers have advanced education and true
				to form, she was the only one in her year who had gone onto more advanced studies.

				We exchanged life/travel
				stories for awhile, and boy has Melanie has had some big adventures!  She's rafted down rivers
				in Cambodia in a leaky boat she found.  She's spent nights in the jungle, with dangerous animals 
				all around and no real protection.  She's hitchiked her way across many of the countries
				by herself.  Hearing about all she's done in just half a year has got me pumped for my
				trip!  After a few hours, we head back to our new home.  We set up a little spot for
				ourselves, burned some anti-mosquito incense that another traveler had given Melanie, and
				called it a night.  
				
				</p>
				
				
				
				<br>
				<p>
				The ground was pretty hard, and mosquitos were still biting, but we got 
				a bit of sleep and woke up feeling decently refreshed.  We were going to meet up with
				Miriam for lunch at noon, and had a few hours before that.  We decided we wanted to
				walk over to the next town (~1hr away) to try to find a room at some cheaper hostels.
				About 10 minutes into our walk, we stopped to ask for directions from this guy at the 
				side of the road.  Apparently he ran a small hostel that we hadn't even noticed, and
				after negotiating the price down by 60%, we decided to get a room there for a couple of
				days.  Now we had a place to stay!

			<p class="blogHead">Through the Jungle</p>
			<p>
				  After a couple days of relaxing and snorkeling on the beaches of the west coast, I
				  was ready for a change of scenery.  We (me, Miriam, Melanie) decided to trek through the jungle to 
				  Juara, on the east side of the island.  My pumas, banana republic chinos, v-neck
				  t-shirt, and AQR jacket weren't the most optimal for jungle trekking, but I would
				  have to make due.  We set out around 9am, after being delayed by a few hours of 
				  morning rain.  
				  </p>
				  <br>
				  <p>
				  The jungle we trekked was really nice.  Some wildlife, lots of interesting plants, a waterfall,
				  and luckily for us, a path through some parts.  Compared to the jungles Melanie had
				  told us about, where they had to cut their own path, this was a breeze!  We walked for
				  about an hour and a half and found a little waterfall we had heard about.  We dipped our
				  toes in, cooled down, and washed off. 
				</p>
				<img ng-src="../img/picPool/JungleO.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
				<img ng-src="../img/picPool/WaterfalO.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
				<br>
				
				<p>
				We continued on, and a short while later found a road that cut through the jungle.  We
				walked along for about half an hour, when a nice stranger in a pickup truck stopped by
				and offered to let us jump in the back.  I took this to mean the bed of the truck so hopped 
				in there, while Melanie and Miriam sweet-talked their way to the backseat.  It was my 
				first time riding out in the bed of a truck, and I really enjoyed it.  We cruised along
				at a reasonable speed (maybe 40mph) and I got to see some great jungle scenery
				and take a few truckbed selfies.
				</p>
				<img ng-src="../img/picPool/HitchHikeO.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
				<br>
				<p>
				Twenty minutes later, we'd arrived to the north end of Juara.  We stopped to help the 
				driver unload the truck, then we got changed and walked down the beach.  Like the beaches
				on our side, this beach was nice and peaceful, not loaded up with tourists like I had
				been partly expecting.  It had nice, soft sand, and I liked that the beach curved
				into a little bay (not sure if that's the right term, hopefully you get what I mean).
				We stayed there and relaxed for a couple more hours, and Melanie and I decided this would
				probably be our last night on the island.  Miriam wanted to stay on the beach longer and
				grab a cab back to our side of the island later, so me and Melanie left for the long trek 
				back.  
				</p>
				<img ng-src="../img/picPool/JuaraO.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
				<br>
				<p>
				We'd walked for about five minutes when we saw a white car coming down the road.  We
				put out our hands to hitch a ride, and the man and his son were nice enough to pull over
				and let us in.  They didn't speak much English, but I guess we looked pretty harmless,
				and we understood that they were going back to the west side beach/town (Tekek) also.
				Half an hour later, we'd made it back!  While we were waiting for Miriam to get back to grab our stuff,
				we found some WiFi and were finally able to check out messages!  Sorry it took me so 
				long to get back to some of you - WiFi on the island was not easy to find, and not 
				very reliable!
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Miriam finally made it back and we grabbed our bags from her, had a last dinner together,
				and said goodbye.  Melanie and I had decided to catch the 6:30am ferry off the island,
				so crashed for a few hours at our pool table house (setting up her mosquito net this time!),
				and then went to the pier.  A quick nap on the ferry and a short walk later, Melanie
				and I finally parted ways at the bus stop.  She was going up to Malacca to head over 
				to Indonesia, and I was going to Kuala Lumpur, on my way up to Chiang Mai.  We said
				our goodbyes, and now I'm off to the next set of adventues!
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Oh some closing thoughts.  This helped me start to appreciate how differently people
				travel.  But also how traveling can bring different people traveling in different ways
				together.  People from all over the world.  Melanie taught me how to backpack in a pretty
				intense way.  It's cool because you can travel the world for almost no money and you can
				stay with locals and really understand different cultures.  But of course it involves some
				risk.

<p>
			After Tioman, I spent a day and a half in Kuala Lumpur getting caught back up on emails, writing a few
			blog posts, reading a book, and doing my taxes.  Exciting stuff.  I walked around the
			city a bit, chilled in Central Market and on Petaling street.  It was way more developed
			than I had expected, and also way more touristy.  Still, the locals there were all really helpful.  
			I was a bit lost at the metro
			station and a local dude helped me buy a ticket and directed me to where I needed to go.
			Turns out he was a coffee bean plantation owner, which I thought was pretty cool.  Anyway,
			I didn't end up staying long in KL, and decided to head up to George Town in Penang.

			After Tioman Island, I spent a day and a half in Kuala Lumpur (KL) getting caught back up on emails, writing a few
			blog posts, reading a book, and doing my taxes.  Exciting stuff.  Then, needing to head up
			north to catch an eventual flight out of Chiang Mai, I continued on to George Town, Penang.
			George Town is a really neat place!  It feels like a blend of New Orleans, the Florida Keys,
			and some carribbean island, but an asian, Muslim version with amazing food!  It's this little island with
			lots of interesting street art, music (I saw Chinese, American, and even a reggae scene), 
			and is apparently the "food paradise of asia."

			<br>
			<p>
			Actually lots of people were telling me before I came that Penang had great food and they were 
			right!  I start by getting a restaurant rec from the dude working at the hostel, and go feast.
			Here's me being that guy who takes pictures of all his food:

			<!-- 
<p>
			After finding my hostel, I asked the guy at the desk for food recs and headed over to 
			CF Cafe.  I start off with Ambra juice and some fried oysters, mixed with tapioca flour batter, chives, 
			eggs, onions, and chili sauce.  I wanted something after that and got Char Koay Teow,
			this wok-fried noodle dish with prawn, eggs, chives, some crispy bits of lard, and sweet pork
			sausage.  Yum. 
			</p>
 -->
			<br>
			<p>
			Hours later, after polishing off multiple meals and enjoying a karaoke performance that starts up in
			the middle of the cafe I'm in, I finally head back to the hostel.  There, I end up grabbing some beers with my hostelmates 
			(a Canadian
			dude and a Scottish couple),
			and we pull up some seats on our balcony to watch an epic rainstorm for a few hours.  
			First off - beers in Muslim countries are expensive!
			Second off - it's been way too long since I've just sat and watched a storm.  Good to appreciate
			the beauty in everyday life.  <a class="underline" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/iain-s-thomas/the-day-you-read-this_b_7100062.html?ir=Books&utm_hp_ref=books"

			<p>
			Right now I'm slightly torn between wanting to hang out with locals vs with other backpackers.
			On one hand, I feel like I'd be getting a more authentic cultural experience if I lived
			and hung out with just locals.  On the other hand, being with backpackers gives me a more
			mixed, international experience.  It's also nice to get other backpackers' perspectives
			of local culture, because of course I'm biased in my own way.
			</p>
			<br>
<!-- 
			I spend the next few days in George Town wandering around the streets, making friends with 
			the local restaurant
			seating good street food
			and taking in really amazing historical sites sprinkled throughout the streets.  I also
			stopped by a flea market with stolen goods one of the days.  Picked up an interesting watch
			with Chinese characters instead of Arabic numbers on it, for 8 RM (~$2).  Still finding it
			hard to get away from wanting to own cool *stuff*.

			<p class="blogHead">Sharing</p>
			
			<p>
			In the grown-up (western) world, it seems like we lose the fun of sharing as we get older.
			When we're kids we share our toys (or at least we're supposed to).  But as we grow up, we start sharing less.
			I realize I've become more possessive of my space and of my things.  
			
			One thing I really like about the backpacking is the culture of sharing.  
			When I was on Tioman, most of Melanie's things seemed to have been passed down to her by
			other travelers.  As I continue my journey, I've been given more from other travelers, and
			have passed along some of my things.  A guy named Blank gave me my first item at the meditation
			retreat - a t-shirt with the Om symbol on it.  At my hostel in George Town, a Dutch guy
			gave me a book called "the curious incident of the dog in the night-time."  It's a book 
			written from the perspecive/writing-style of an autistic person.  It was a quick read
			and I really enjoyed the different perspective.
			</p>
			<br>
			<img ng-src="../img/picPool/Book.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
			<br>
			<p>
			The first things I've started passing along are the books that I've finished reading.
			The book they gave me during the Vipassana retreat.  The Little Prince.  Yes, they were
			definitely books I would have liked to keep and hold onto.  But after reading through them,
			it only seemed fair to let others enjoy them on their trips also.  Besides the hours spent
			together on the road or hanging out and chatting, sharing books is another form of idea sharing,
			which is a really important part of backpacking.  Ideas of a place and culture are carried by one backpacker,
			interpreted through their own culture, and shared in a different time,
			different place, with a different group.  And thankfully, idea sharing isn't another type
			of sharing that's been lost over time.  With the internet, sharing things has become incredibly
			fast and easy.  It's now the filtering that seems to matter more. 
			
			
<!-- 
			What is it that people like about famous things?  They seem to make popular destinations
			when people go to visit places.  Partially, it may be something to do with an availability
			bias.  People have heard about them, so want to go.  Also, it seems to have something to
			do with being able to talk to others about those things.  But do those things really
			give you a good flavor of what a place is like?  Maybe.  I guess those things were or perhaps
			are important to the local people, which is what made them famous.

			<p class="blogHead">Train and Perspective</p>
			
			<p>
			After a few days in George Town, I decided it was time to head up to Chiang Mai for Songkran!
			A couple of issues with the train ticket stand later (not possible to book tickets online,
			no electricity one day),
			I was on a sleeper train heading up north.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Me and this French guy (Aurelien) were lucky enough to get beds next to this super hyperactive,
			really loud little Malay kid.  I used a bottle cap to play fetch with him for a bit, 
			which was entertaining, then made the bottle cap disappear.  That
			kept him busy for a surprisingly long time.
			</p>
			<img ng-src="../img/picPool/MalayKid.jpg" width="280" height="220"/>
			
			
			<br>
			<p>
			One part of traveling I really enjoy is getting a new perspective.  Part of this is illustrated
			in studies on problem solving (link to matchbox study).  I was reminded of this on the train
			when seeing people drinking out of plastic bags
			and when I was talking to Aurelien.   A couple of things stood out.  At one point, I gave him some
			extra ear plugs I had, to help with the noisy kid.  He started wondering what the 
			best way to wear them was - flat end in first, rounded end in first, or even sideways or some
			other way!  It occurred to me that I'd never really thought about that before. I'd always
			just taken it for granted that the rounded end goes in first.  Also, when we were getting off
			the train, I looked and the train seemed longer than when I had gotten on.  Aurelien suggested
			that maybe at the stops we had been connecting to other trains.  Good thought!
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Aurelien's local friend met us at the Bangkok train station.  They were going to stay in 
			Bangkok for a few days before maybe meeting up with me in Chiang Mai.  We said our goodbyes,
			and a few hours later I was on the second leg of my trip, up to enjoy Songkran in Chiang Mai!
			</p>
			
			<!--

			Aurelien had just finished his geography degree in the UK, and was traveling for five weeks
			while waiting to hear back about his application for an urban planning masters, in Amsterdam.

			<p class="blogHead">Feeling Stressed</p>
			<p>
			Not sure why, but today I'm feeling stressed out.  I'll go through the day and see
			what happened.  I woke up, checked out of the hostel in George Town (Cocoa Mews), and
			went to the train ticket counter to grab a train to head up to Bangkok and then Chian Mai.
			Unfortunately today's trains were all fully booked, so I got one for tomorrow, and then
			went back to the hostel to extend my stay by a day.  They'd run out of beds in the 8 bed 
			dorm I'd been in before (need to write some more about my hostelmates - a dude from Hawaii (David),
			a Canadian dude (Rob), a Scottish couple, a Dutch guy, and some other dudes), but they actually gave me
			this nice two bed room with better air conditioning for the same price!  I'm chilling here
			planning out my trip and working on this site a bit.
			
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			I think part of it is just not wanting to deal with people for awhile.  I think I go through
			some super introverted phases (as my cousin James will attest to).  Actually, maybe reading
			through the book the Dutch dude gave me (the curious incident of the dog in the night-time)
			is biasing me, but it reminds me of the feeling the autistic kid in the book describes 
			when he is being overwhelmed.  Less extreme though.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Ah, I laid here for a bit and meditated, and feel much better now.  I think it's because
			I was planning my trip to France to work on a vineyard via workaway.com.  Was fun, but was 
			taking awhile, and I think I feel a strong sense of urgency to get things done right away.
			Because it was going slowly I think that was frustrating me.

			<p class="blogHead">Tioman Recap</p>
			
			<p>
			Whew, just boarded a bus up to Kuala Lumpur and it's nice to relax, enjoy the A/C, and
			get some writing in.  A lot of experiences to catch up on and record before the fade from
			my memory.  A bit tired from last night - me and Melanie slept in our first-night home again
			which wasn't very comfortable, and woke up at 4:30 to catch the first ferry back.  Tioman
			was a nice way to ease back into the real world after meditating for 10 days.  Nice people,
			not too many people, chill environment.  Nice to have some people from the program to hang out
			with too.  Overall, I'm not a huge fan of vacationing to beaches/islands.  Like cities, I
			think they're generally pretty similar, and kind of bland.  Sure they're beautiful and 
			relaxing, but most of the time that's not what I'm after.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>
			I also realized/confirmed that I'm very susceptible to being influenced by others.  I have
			some pretty strong inherent desire to please and be agreeable.  I'd like to put a positive
			spin on it and say it's because I'm open minded and generally open to trying to do what others
			want.  It's interesting because I'm also really opinionated about some things.  Trying to
			figure out how to accept (not the right word) the two in my mind.  Though traveling with 
			the Germans was fun, I do like the independence of doing my own thing.  There is some
			inherent pressure to hang out even though it's really low.  Maybe deep down I am an introvert
			in that I want to get away and be able to do my own thing whenever I want.  I'd like to
			be able to ignore all others and only interact with people when I choose to.  That said,
			Tioman was really fun.  I feel like I really got to learn the more intense, independent, 
			open backpacker style by hanging out with Melanie.  Learned to hitchhike, live wherever,
			interact with and negotiate better with locals, etc.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Also further developed my awareness of the difficulty in hanging out with people of different
			spending levels.  It's especially evident in looking at short term travelers with jobs compared
			to long-term travelers without.  I should probably be targeting short-term travelers because
			those travelers spend money ridiculously compared to long-term travelers. 
			Not sure if spending levels are a consequence of desires for a certain level
			of comfort of vice versa. Vacation vs lifestyle mentality maybe.

			<p class="blogHead">Current Theories</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>My price level adapts.  Baseline is reasonable, going for good value.  Might seem silly
			to distinguish between 30 baht vs 60 baht, when difference is only $1.  I instinctively do though.</p>
			<p>Inherently I feel less satisfied with doing nothing/status quo than others appear to feel.
			Maybe my Maslow hierarchy is better met?</p>
			<p>I think I can not give enough importance to other people's feelings.</p>
			<p>Ideal pursuit of mission involves some balance of playfulness and urgency.</p>
			<p>Looking at this now, most backpacking seems really empty.  Just people going experience-
			gathering.  What really matters is how you affect other people.  Creating something
			beautiful and inspiring.  For travel, it may be sharing your own culture with theirs.
			Maybe that's the beauty in backpacking.</p>
			<p>Finance is too focused on oneself.  Deeper satisfaction comes from making others happy.</p>
			<p>Backpacking can both make you more tolerant and less tolerant.  Greater tolerance/patience
			comes as you're exposed to new cultures and see more.  But because of the freedom of backpacking,
			one can also choose to remove himself from situations he doesn't like.  That can make you
			very intolerant of other things (like people in high finance).  Be careful of this.</p>
			<p>Creating your own meaning.  Like the Little Prince Quote - You are beautiful, but you are
			empty.   One cannot die for you.</p>
			<p>More important than just traveling for a year, is to have this year to myself, to just
			explore myself.  This time is invaluable.  I haven't thought thoughts like these in awhile, 
			and it's only the first day.</p>
			
			
			<p>My cab driver was 28, looked like he was 48.  I'd already negotiated a flat rate, hopefully
			this wasn't just some sob story to get me to pay more (and I feel bad for even thinking that
			cynically, but it's a real possibility).  Apparently his father had died when he was seven.  
			His mother was a strong woman, but he had to go work.  So he went to work for a Chinese 
			guy for a long time, who gave him food and took him in.  Two years ago, he had a love 
			marriage with an Indian Christian woman, who grew up close to him (actually I thought
			he said they'd gone to school together, but he also said he didn't go to school,
			potential hole in the story or just some confusion on my part?).  Two years ago he also
			left the Chinese guys restaurant and started driving the cab.  He picked me up around 5am, 
			says he works until 8am, goes back and sleeps until 11am, and drives more.  Bankers take note of
			that.  A couple things I take note of here.  If this stuff is true (actually even if not), let
			me take a moment and be thankful that I have relatively won the genetic lottery.  Second thing,
			partially he's had to work due to circumstance (most of us have to also).  But the jobs he does,
			he does because of what's available, and because of how they help him in the short term.  If
			I think of what's best for him in the long-term, it's not driving a cab 21 hours a day.
			Compared to him I'm lucky.  But then I think, he probably does what he does because he can't
			imagine a better way of life, a better way to go about it and invest in the future.  Although
			relative to him, I can look more to the future, I also imagine that there are many people out there
			who look at my life the way I look at this man's life.  To them I look like I'm focused on the day-
			to-day, looking to make a quick buck and not thinking long-term.  I'm striving to do that more.

			<p>
			Time while long-term traveling is interesting.  There's a documentary called "A Map For Saturday,"
			so named because every day feels like a Saturday.  It's a pretty good description.  I'm writing
			this at 4am local time here.  More "normal" hours have the practicality of sunlight, food, and activities.
			But these hours afford me quiet and fewer distractions.  I work when I feel like working, 
			travel and relax when I feel like it.  It's very nice.

			<p class="blogHead">Tokyo!</p>
			
			<p>
			Got in to Tokyo and wandered around with my mom.  Feels natural, same same, just new city
			to explore.  Very cool.  In some ways very different from backpacking around.  But it's 
			cool and similar in other ways.  After exploring during the day we'll just hang out and chat
			in the room for a few hours.  Outside of the everyday routine, there's more time to just hang out.
			Also, I realize I'm more emotional and have less control over some strong emotions than I had
			thought.  Darn.  Oh well, just gotta rock it.
			
			Day Two.  Man, Tokyo is super different, and I'm just starting to realize it.  I think real 
			culture shock usually takes some extended time living in a place to kick in, but I feel
			like I'm getting a small dose of it already.  In the background, there's a sense of being slightly
			overwhelmed.  A gnawing discomfort, not fundamentally "getting" things.  On the surface things seem pretty similar.  
			Big city.  Shiny new buildings, good public transport, polite people dressed in business clothes.  But it's like
			that daft punk video.  Just the outside appearance is something I know.  Then you notice the anime everywhere. 
			And girls dressed up in anime costumes advertising cafes.  And then you go in a cafe,
			and it's like you're in some alternate world where the waitstaff are roleplaying
			anime characters.  Slightly concerning when they're all wearing schoolgirl anime outfits,
			customers are almost all dudes, and you're with your mom.  But then, more than anything sexual, it's an alternate reality
			where your meal is interrupted by impromptu light shows while the girls sing songs from anime
			movies.  Very surreal.
			
			And mixed in with this oddly captivating, childlike, internet-meme world with anime and collectibles,
			are high tech electronics.  I played around with the Occulus Rift.  I found temperature-controlled
			shoes.  I think the US has been good with web/software startups, but we could learn from
			Japan just based on the hardware I've seen.  Maybe I haven't looked hard enough at US hardware.
