			<p class="blogHead">Me</p>
			
	       	<p>Hi world!  My name is Forrest.  I'm a 25 year old guy from the US,
	       	leaving behind a high-paying job at a hedge fund for long-term,
        	low-budget travel around the world.  Here's the story of how I got here.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p> 
			I grew up in Kansas. Maybe it's because there wasn't much to do there and I had to 
			make my own entertainment, maybe it's just who I am, but I developed a taste for exploration and adventure. 
			My friends and I would ride our bikes around when we were younger, checking out new neighborhoods, occasionally 
			getting into trouble for our shenanigans. My adventure-seeking continued to grow with time. I picked up pole vaulting in high school, which was a great 
			outlet for my energy. In college, I joined an awesome group of guys in a fraternity. 
			We drank a lot, did secret fraternity stuff, the whole deal. I studied neuroscience in school, and spent 
			as much time experimenting with substances outside of class as I did in my labs. 
			An amazing, fun, transformative, and surreal four years later, I graduated and was ready to move on.
			
			
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>
			And so I entered the "real world," a bright-eyed kid armed with a strong 
			sense of optimism and a newly acquired degree. Instead 
			of following the traditional neuroscience path of becoming a doctor or doing research, 
			I decided this was my chance to try out a job, make some money, and see what else was out there. 
			I was really lucky and managed to get a job at Goldman Sachs, so I was off to NYC! 
			Say what you want about the vampire squids, but I have a ton of respect for Goldman. 
			I was surrounded by talented, driven people, and they taught me how to really work. 
			At the same time, I got to live in one of the most amazing cities I've ever been to 
			(more on that later)! I had a great group of friends, enough money for the expensive 
			lifestyle, and the youthful endurance needed to go out in the city that never 
			sleeps.
			
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>
			A fun and intense year later, I again got lucky and was offered a job at a 
			quantitative hedge fund in Connecticut. I accepted, jumping at the chance to 
			learn from former Harvard professors and some of the most respected people in 
			the quant world. But as I settled in, I realized I wasn't happy. Yes, I was 
			making more money than a 23 year old probably should and was living what looked 
			like a nice life. Black cars drove me from Connecticut back to NYC where I still 
			lived. I could (and am embarrassed to say, did) spend hundreds of dollars a 
			night on dinner or going out. But I wasn't happy. Life 
			wasn't about making money so I could buy nice things, then needing to make even more 
			money to buy even nicer things. I wanted to live an inspired life filled with 
			amazing people and experiences and help others do the same. I wanted to surround myself 
			with passionate, inspired people who were living the dream!
			
			
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>
			So here I am. Leaving behind the safety of a good, stable job for the adventure 
			of the road. Working to create something I believe in, to help others see the world that 
			I'm lucky enough to experience.
			
			</p>

            <p class="blogHead">Living Homelessly</p>
 			
 			<p>
 			At the end of January I got rid of my apartment, packed everything I needed into my backpack, 
 			and started living homelessly. It's been a great month, and especially great as my last 
 			month in the country! I've been able to see good friends one last time, save some 
 			extra money for my travels, and also test out my travel gear. I definitely 
 			recommend it for those who are planning a nomadic lifestlye.
 			
 			</p>
 			<br>
 			<p>
 			Still, it's not for everyone. I remember my first day of being homeless - I got back to the city 
 			around 6pm, the sun was going down, and I felt nervous that I might not find a place 
 			to sleep for the night. Luckily, my cousin James was around. We grabbed a drink, hung out 
 			at the bar for awhile, and I ended up crashing on his couch. It turned out to be a really fun night! 
 			Since then, I haven't felt that same twinge of nervousness. Instead, I've 
 			felt empowered, free to explore and move about. I've stayed with friends in New York, Connecticut, and even Colorado. 
 			With no worries of where I need to end up for the night, I've been able to be much more spontaneous.
 			
 			</p>
 			<br>
 			<p>
 			I've had great nights that started with no plans. One night I ended up going out with this cool girl 
 			I first met on Tinder, meeting up with my friend from school, 
 			and getting brunch the next morning before work (weekday brunch is awesome by the way)! I've also had nights that went less smoothly. 
 			Another night I was at my friend's party, having a great time. We decided to go out to the lower 
 			east side and bust out our sweet dance moves. We got separated during the night, and I ended up not 
 			being able to stay at her place like I'd thought I would. I had this realization at around 3am. 
 			It also happened to be one of the coldest nights of the year! Luckily, another friend lived around 
 			the area, and I was able to sleep at his place. All in all, it's been a great experience. Even 
 			the unexpected, tough times have ended up as good memories.
 			
 			
 			<p/>
 			<br>
 			
 			<p>
 			Don't get me wrong, it's definitely nice to have a home. It's comfortable and stable, 
 			a great place to come back to and relax. You don't worry about where you're going to 
 			sleep, or shower, or go to the bathroom (turns out a gym membership is super useful, at least for the latter two). 
 			You don't worry about how you're going to 
 			fit a months worth of work clothes into a backpack. 
 			But at the same time, an apartment can become 
 			burdensome. It's been very freeing to finally remove the clutter from my life. 
 			My apartment was full of stuff I didn't need, but that I held onto, for some distant 
 			day in the future. I think it was mostly a fear of letting go. It's been nice to let go 
 			of that stuff, and then of my apartment too. 
 			Tomorrow, I'll be fully uncluttering my life by letting go of one last thing - my job.

			<p class="blogHead">Goodbye Corporate Life</p>
			
			<p>
			My last corporate email:
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			All,
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>
			Today is my last day at AQR.  Even though this wasn’t the place for me, I’m thankful 
			for my time here and for everything I’ve learned.  I now have a better understanding of 
			finance, of the “real world,” and more importantly, of myself.  I’ve learned to be more 
			practical, while realizing that I’m a deeply idealistic person.  I’ve learned to 
			appreciate the structure and routine of daily corporate life, while realizing that I 
			thrive in a dynamic, flexible environment.  Ultimately, I’ve learned that staying here 
			would mean not staying true to myself.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>
			That’s too bad, since staying here would put me on a very nice, comfortable path.  
			Year after year, we make more money.  We eat out at ever-fancier restaurants, then 
			come back to our progressively nicer houses.  We take our families on ever-more-luxurious 
			vacations.  But this isn’t the life I dream of.  Sure, it sounds like a good life.  
			I can’t argue with that.  It turns out that $400 meals can be pretty tasty.  And it’s 
			almost ridiculous to not be upset after waking up to a $600 bill from the night before 
			(thanks again for splitting that guys).  But still, I feel a lack of fulfillment.
			</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>
			What’s important to me is to have a purpose, to fight for something meaningful.  
			Yes, maybe our purpose is to help participants in underfunded pensions receive the 
			benefits they’ve been promised.  But if I really believed in that, I would work for 
			less money.  Instead, over the past few years I’ve become more and more obsessed with 
			making money, in part because I’ve used it as a measure of myself.  I worry that I’ve 
			lost the sense of purpose that I once felt, the desire to help the world in some 
			meaningful way.  Of course, I say all of this from a position of privilege, while 
			making enough to not be worried about money.  But now that I’m here, this is an 
			opportunity I can’t waste.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>
			So I’m making a change.  Wiping away this clear path toward “success” was tough.  
			The road ahead of me is less clear.  But too many people avoid taking the first step 
			forward, just because they can’t see where the path leads.  I don’t want to live my 
			life like that.  I’m off in pursuit of something more.
			</p>
			
			<br>
			<p>
			I’ll be traveling the world, heading out on a one way flight to Thailand on March 11.  
			Not sure how long I’ll be abroad – I’m thinking a year or so to start.  At the same 
			time, I’ll be working on my own project.  You can follow my progress and travel 
			experiences here: <a href="#/blog">http://www.splashee.com/#/blog</a>.  Hope to 
			see some of you out on the road.
			</p>

			<br>
			<p>What do I hope to accomplish over this next period of my life?  I hope to see the world
			and the amazing people and experiences it's filled with. To understand different perspectives
			and ways of life.  To be amazed and shocked, to question what I know and to grow from that.
			I want to put myself in new, untested environments.  To gauge my current
			views against what are now only unknown unknowns.
			I imagine there will be plenty of "what the fuck!?" moments - both good and
			bad.  
			
			Though there will be locals, backpackers, and other people around me, I imagine my true
			company will be myself.  It'll be a time to reflect, to enjoy my own company and
			better understand who I am and what I want.  I have a certain set of ideas now, 
			and we'll see how these hold up.
			
			No matter what, I'll treasure this time and opportunity that I have.  But I do fear some
			consequences.  Not of disease, injury, and crime, though those are real issues.  I fear
			that this trip will take me off the deep end. That by becoming some blend of all these different
			worlds, I'll never be able to integrate into any individual one. That I'll be so changed by the experience that
			I wont ever accept a more "normal" life.  I know already that's
			a part of my work attitude.  I'm constantly reaching, working to create and improve.  At first I worried that
			I may not ever truly be happy if I'm never satisfied with the status quo.  Over time, I've
			learned to enjoy the process of constantly reaching, and not the accomplishment of reaching some 
			given target.  I think this could also be a dangerous attiude for relationships.  So far it hasn't
			been the same, but then again, I've lived and enjoyed the single life for quite awhile, so maybe something's thre.
