        	BLOG TITLE - FROM FINANCE TO FREEDOM

	       	<p>I'm leaving behind a high-paying job at a hedge fund for long-term,
        	low-budget travel around the world.  But let's back up - how did I end
        	up here?</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>I entered the "real world" as a bright-eyed kid armed with a strong 
			sense of optimism and a newly acquired degree in Neuroscience.  Instead 
			of following the traditional path of becoming a doctor, I decided this was 
			my chance to try out a job, make some money, and see what else was out there.  
			I was really lucky and managed to get a job at Goldman Sachs, so I was off to NYC!  
			Say what you want about the vampire squids, but I have a ton of respect for Goldman.  
			I was surrounded by talented, driven people, and they taught me how to really work.  
			At the same time, I got to live in one of the most amazing cities I've ever been to 
			(more on that later)!  I had a great group of friends, enough money for the expensive 
			city lifestyle, and the youthful endurance needed to go out in the city that never 
			sleeps.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>An intense year later, I was again very lucky and was offered a job at a 
			quantitative hedge fund in Connecticut.  I accepted, jumping at the chance to 
			learn from former Harvard professors and some of the most respected people in 
			the quant world.  But as I settled in, I realized I wasn't happy.  Yes, I was 
			making more money than a 23 year old probably should and was living what looked
			like a nice life.  Black cars drove me from Connecticut back to NYC where I still 
			lived.  I could (and am embarrassed to say, sometimes did) spend $500 dollars a 
			night on dinner or going out.  But I wasn't happy.  I could feel my optimism, 
			idealism, and passion for living life draining away, and that sucked. </p>
			
			<p></p>
			<p>In finance, I felt surrounded by people with no passion for what they were 
			doing, just there to make lots of money.  And worse yet, I was becoming one of 
			these people.  What was I creating?  I made money into more money and I guess 
			that helped some people.  Why did I have to sit at this desk for ten hours a day?  
			This was the 21st century; all of my work could be done remotely.  I could be out 
			seeing the world!  As these thoughts gnawed at me, I decided I needed to go.  Life 
			wasn't about making money so I could buy nice things, then needing to make even more 
			money to buy even nicer things.  I wanted to live an inspired life filled with 
			amazing experiences and help others do the same.  I wanted to surround myself 
			with passionate, inspired people that were living the lives they dared to dream of. </p>
			
			<p></p>
			<p>So here I am.  Leaving behind the safety of a good, stable job for the adventure 
			of the road.  Working to create something I believe in, to help others see the world that
			I'm lucky enough to experience.  </p>
